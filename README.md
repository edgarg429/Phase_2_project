# Kings County Housing Analysis

## A Phase 1 Project

**Author**: Edgar Gonzalez

### Overview

My research seeks to provide predictions into housing prices for the Kings County Area in Washington State 


### Data 

Datasets used can be found in the repository in `data` folder which was provided by The Flatiron School.


### Methods

Created and changed certain features in the dataset to uncover correalation between price of house and the features of a house.
Used various statistical tests to evaluate changes in features and whether they were significant or not.

### Results
#### The zipcode in which the house is located tend to have a high effect on the price of the house


#### Grade seems to have an exponential effect on the price of the house


#### Houses built in the 1970s tended to be valued lower than houses build earlier or later

### Conclusions
While sqft_living, zipcode, and grade of a house greatly affect the price of a house, there are a number of other factors that were not considered in the research, such as proximity to schools, commerce centers, and land marks or crime rate of neighborhood. Thes factors should be considered as they too might has an unknown effect on housing price.

# Kings County Housing Anaylysis

## A Phase 1 Project

**Author**: Edgar Gonzalez

### Overview

My research seeks to provide predictions into housing prices for the Kings County Area in Washington State 


### Data 

Datasets used can be found in the repository under `kc_house_data_train.csv` which was provided by The Flatiron School.


### Methods

Created and changed certain features in the data set to uncover correalation between price of house and the features of a house.
Used various statistical test to evalauate changes in features and wherether they were significant or not.

### Results
#### The zipcode in which the house is located tend to have a high effect on the price of the house


#### Grade seems to have an exponential effect on the price of the house


#### Houses built in the 1970s tended to be valued lower than houses build earlier or later

### Conclusion
A notebook with my Exploratory Data Analysis can be found as `Untitle` as well as the statistical testing amd model evaluation
